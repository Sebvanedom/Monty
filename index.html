              Oh, oh, I see! Running away, eh? You yellow bastards! Come back here and take what's coming to you! I'll bite your legs off!
              You don't frighten us, English pig dogs. Go and boil your bottoms, you sons of a silly person.
              I blow my nose at you, so-called "Arthur King," you and all your silly English K-nig-hts.
              What is the capital of Assyria?
              Listen, strange women lyin' in ponds distributin' swords is no basis for a system of government.
              Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
              Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
              The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water,
              signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. THAT is why I am your king.
              I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough wiper! I fart in your general direction!
              Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!

            There's no Messiah in here. There's a mess all right, but no Messiah. Now go away!
            I will not have my fwends widiculed by the common soldiewy. Anybody else feel like a little... giggle...
            when I mention my fwiend... Biggus... Dickus?
            Stwike him, Centuwion! Stwike him vewy wuffly! At this time,
            a friend shall lose his friend's hammer and the young shall not know where lieth the things possessed by their fathers that their fathers
            put there only just the night before, about eight o'clock.
            Well, I think I should point out first, Brian, in all fairness,
            we are not, in fact, the rescue committee. However, I have been asked to read the following prepare statement on behalf of the movement.
            "We the People's Front of Judea, brackets, officials, end brackets, do hereby convey our sincere fraternal and sisterly greetings to you,
            Brian, on this, the occasion of your martyrdom."
            This is boring. Let's go watch a stoning. Oh, what wouldn't I give to be spat at in the face?
            I sometimes hang awake at night, dreaming of being spat at in the face
            All right, but apart from the sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and public health,
            what have the Romans ever done for us?

          Hegel is arguing that the reality is merely an a priori adjunct of non-naturalistic ethics, Kant via the categorical imperative is holding that ontologically it exists only in the imagination, and Marx claims it was offside. Is your wife a goer, eh? Know what I mean? Know what I mean? Nudge, nudge! Know what I mean? Say no more!
          It's not pining, it's passed on! This parrot is no more! It has ceased to be! It's expired and gone to meet its maker! This is a late parrot! It's a stiff! Bereft of life, it rests in peace! If you hadn't nailed it to the perch, it would be pushing up the daisies! It's metabolic processes are now history! He's off the twig! He's kicked the bucket, he's shuffled off the mortal coil, rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. This is an ex-parrot!
          If we took the bones out, it wouldn't be crunchy, would it? I cut down trees, I skip and jump, I like to press wildflowers. I put own womens' clothing, and hang around in bars.
          We interrupt this program to annoy you and make things generally irritating. I object to all this sex on the television. I mean, I keep falling off!
          We use only the finest baby frogs, dew picked and flown from Iraq, cleansed in finest quality spring water, lightly killed, and then sealed in a succulent Swiss quintuple smooth treble cream milk chocolate envelope and lovingly frosted with glucose. I told you to lay off the beans, you whore!

        I mean, because we are members of the Protestant Reformed Church, which successfully challenged the autocratic power of the Papacy in the mid-sixteenth century, we can wear little rubber devices to prevent issue.
        Look at them, bloody Catholics, filling the bloody world up with bloody people they can't afford to bloody feed. We have to go. Uhm... I'm having rather heavy period. Well, had I got as far as the penis entering the vagina? What's wrong with a kiss, boy? Hmm? Why not start her off with a nice kiss? You don't have to go leaping straight for the clitoris like a bull at a gate. Give her a kiss, boy.
        Oh, waiter! This conversation isn't very good. If a sperm is wasted God gets quite irate. That's what being a Protestant's all about. That's why it's the church for me. That's why it's the church for anyone who respects the individual and the individual's right to decide for him or herself. When Martin Luther nailed his protest up to the church door in fifteen-seventeen, he may not have realised the full significance of what he was doing, but four hundred years later, thanks to him, my dear, I can wear whatever I want on my John Thomas...
        All right, settle down. Settle down... Now, before I begin the lesson, will those of you who are playing in the match this afternoon move your clothes down onto the lower peg immediately after lunch, before you write your letter home, if you're not getting your hair cut, unless you've got a younger brother who is going out this weekend as the guest of another boy, in which case, collect his note before lunch, put it in your letter after you've had your hair cut, and make sure he moves your clothes down onto the lower peg for you.
        And finally, a wafer thin mint. I'm afraid I have no choice but to sell you all for scientific experiments. Oh and Jenkins, apparently your mother died this morning.
